# Sharp Sharp with C# 6 Demo code

This is the base demo code I used in my talks about what is new in C# 6. The demo covers:
- [Index Initialisers](http://www.sadev.co.za/content/index-initialisers-c-6)
- [Auto-properties with initializers](http://www.sadev.co.za/content/auto-properties-initializers-c-6)
- [Read-only auto-properties](http://www.sadev.co.za/content/read-only-auto-properties-c-6)
- [Static Using Statements] (http://www.sadev.co.za/content/static-using-statements-c-6)
- [Await in catch blocks](http://www.sadev.co.za/content/exceptions-what-happens-when-exception-occurs-inside-catch-or-inside-when-c-6-how-smart)
- Exception Filtering
- Null Propogation (the nullet operator)
- NameOf
- Expression Bodied Members
- String Interpolation

There are TWO branches, `master` has the clean base for the demos which shows the current way we work with C#. The `Completed_Demos` branch has an example for what it could change to with C# 6.
